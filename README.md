# Notes: 
1. We are looking at the chinook records data base.
2. The Chinook database contains information about songs, artists, employees, customers (purchases) from a music store.
3. The data is stored in a relational data base across 11 tables.
4. We are only going to use some of the information and take a focus on data involving purchases in the USA.
